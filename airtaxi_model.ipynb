    "The demand for road travel exceeds the supply given how fast urban populations are growing. Building new roadways and public transit are time consuming and capital intensive in nature, making it almost impossible for cities to meet the growing demand.\n",

    "According to a recent study, U.S. drivers lost an average of 99 hours equivalent to 1,377 dollars in 2019 due to traffic congestions. (88 billion in national average)\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic vertical take-off and landing (E-VTOL) aircrafts create a whole new form of transportation, providing solutions for a faster commute, air travel in-between cities and daily operations that does not require a huge infrastucture build. The lower operating cost, lower noise and zero-carbon emission of the eVTOLs also allows service to be more frequent, available in many locations within the city, and finally establish itself as a major form of transportation for times to come."

    "By looking at just the Fastrak data, we were able to identify the most optimal locations, routes that covers the most distance and forecast an average demand of 50,000 travellers everyday. Some of the other key findings were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On an average there seems to be an hourly demand of above 2500 customers at all locations. This only represents 10% of the total flow of traffic daily.\n",
    "- Considering most of the travel was happening during morning and evening rush hours, an operating schedule between the hours of 6 AM and 12 AM would benefit the most travellers.\n",
    "- In terms of service location, we identified a total of 10 locations that would be optimal to cover all movements in the area.\n",
    "- Keeping only routes that take at least 8 minutes of flight time, we arrive at 15 different combinations that can be implemented for our first phase.\n",
    "- Each of these routes are at least 4 times faster than conventional travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of what air taxi we choose, it is pretty evident that there will be more than enough demand for this service. The travel being more than 3-4 times faster will also make this service invaluable at all price ranges. This is a great opportunity and investors should definitely take part to make this a success."

    "- In terms of service locations, we identified a total of 10 locations that would be optimal to cover all movements across the area.\n",
    "- Considering all combination of travel between these locations, and keeping only the routes that take at least 8 minutes of flight time, we arrive at 15 different routes that will benefit the most from this service.\n",
    "- Each of these routes are at least 4 times faster than conventional travel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "By looking at just the Fastrak data, we are able to identify the most optimal locations, routes that covers the most distance and forecast an average demand of 50,000 travellers everyday. Regardless of what air taxi we choose or follow a certain pricing plan, it is pretty evident that there will be more than enough demand for this service. The travel being more than 4-5 times faster will also make this service invaluable at all price ranges. This is a great opportunity and investors should definitely take part to make this a success."
